SMHackBot
=========

IRC bot for Southern Maryland Hackerspace.  #SMHack on Freenode.

It was derived from version 2.5 of Unallocated Space's IRC Bot (http://www.unallocatedspace.org/wiki/IRC_Bot).  SSL connectivity and greetings were added to the code.  If you have any ideas for added functionality please let us know.
